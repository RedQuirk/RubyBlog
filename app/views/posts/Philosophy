Billy's philosphy of being software development: Being lazy and problem solving
Problem solving – the way you brake down a big problem into lots of smaller problems and tasks.
E.g. to make a sandwhich is a lot of effort;
telling yourself to first decide your filling,
cut the bread you will always use,
then putting in the filling.

This is a far easier way to make a sandwhich.

Being lazy – putting the least amount of work into something to do an excellent job.

So don't go and make a super complex program when you only had to solve a simple task.

Consider if being lazy with a solution now will mean twice as much work in a few weeks instead of a little bit of extra time now on the lazy solution you are tempted to do.

Also, don't go about making a really fast and robust program now when you do not have to, this will save time.

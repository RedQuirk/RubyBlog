RubyMine is the best.

This was typed into the Ruby on Rails thing:
#RubyMine is the best:
#Click and follow: want to see the source code of a function that's used in another function? Just click on the function and follow.
#when working on a large team project, this will allow you to see who was the last person to write or change that function.
#Run tests right from the spec. Simply click and rubymine will run teh test from that spec right in ruby mine.
#Git compare, its really easy to compare your current file with the same file on a different branch. Even a previous version of that file on the same file.
